I am currently a Postdoctoral Associate at the Department of Mathematics of University of Maryland at College Park working on Optimization and Scientific Machine Learning, supervised by [Prof. Haizhao Yang](https://haizhaoyang.github.io/). I received my B.S. (01 July 2017) in Mathematics from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), and Ph.D. (30 November 2021) in Mathematics from NUS where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Kim-Chuan Toh](https://blog.nus.edu.sg/mattohkc/). 

Here is my [CV](/files/CV_LING_LIANG.pdf).
