I am currently a Postdoctoral Associate in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Maryland, College Park, where I work on Optimization and Scientific Machine Learning with [Prof. Haizhao Yang](https://haizhaoyang.github.io/). I earned my B.S. in Mathematics from the University of Science and Technology of China in June 2017 and my Ph.D. in Mathematics (fortunately supervised by [Prof. Kim-Chuan Toh](https://blog.nus.edu.sg/mattohkc/)) from the National University of Singapore in November 2021. 

My research focuses on the development, analysis, and implementation of efficient, robust, and scalable algorithmic frameworks for solving large-scale optimization problems and their applications in Machine Learning, Scientific Computing, and Engineering, aiming to bridge theoretical advancements with practical solutions.
