I am currently a Postdoctoral Associate at the Department of Mathematics of University of Maryland at College Park working on Optimization and Scientific Machine Learning, supervised by [Prof. Haizhao Yang](https://haizhaoyang.github.io/). I received my B.S. (June 2017) in Mathematics from University of Science and Technology of China, and Ph.D. (November 2021) in Mathematics from National University of Singapore where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Kim-Chuan Toh](https://blog.nus.edu.sg/mattohkc/). 

**I am on the job market for a tenure-track position**. Here is my [CV](/files/CV_LING_LIANG.pdf).

Current research interests
======
- **Optimization**: Fast algorithms for large-scale conic programming and its applications
- **Machine Learning and Data Science**: Optimal experimental design and learn to optimize
- **Scientific Computing**: Numerical linear algebra and numerical analysis
