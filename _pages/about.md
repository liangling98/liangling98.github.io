I am currently a Postdoctoral Associate at the Department of Mathematics of University of Maryland at College Park working on Optimization and Scientific Machine Learning, supervised by [Prof. Haizhao Yang](https://haizhaoyang.github.io/). Prior to this, I was a Research Fellow at the Department of Mathematics of National University of Singapore (NUS), mentored by [Prof. Kim-Chuan Toh](https://blog.nus.edu.sg/mattohkc/), and was a Visiting Postdoctoral Researcher at the Weierstrasse Institute for Applied Analysis and Stochastics working with [Dr. Jia-Jie Zhu](https://jj-zhu.github.io/). I received my B.S. (01 July 2017) in Mathematics from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) and Ph.D. (30 November 2021) in Mathematics from NUS where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. Kim-Chuan Toh. 

This is my [CV](/files/CV_LING_LIANG.pdf).
